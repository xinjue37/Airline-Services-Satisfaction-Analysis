Author: Ng Zheng Jue, Ong Ming Jie, Tan Hong Guan

* This is a project developed in undergraduate Year 3 - Semester 1.
* The repository consists
    * 1 Jupyter notebook file that contains code about pre-processing the airline services satisfaction data, choose the most relavant features from it, and perform factor analysis to find the factor of the features.
    * If you are interested how it implemented and more details, you can see the **Report.pdf** for details
* The data we used are [Kaggle Airline Passenger Satisfaction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/airline-passenger-satisfaction)

## Abstract
The airline industry continues to remain as one of the most competitive industries. All
airlines provide the same core service: to transport passengers around the world via air
transport. To differentiate themselves from the rest, each airline must have their own unique
selling point to attract new and existing customers. In our paper, the services provided by the
airline, both general services and in-flight services will be focused.
Using a dataset obtained from Kaggle, consisting of 129,880 customer responses, this
study aims to analyse and prioritise various observable variables related to in-flight and
general services. Then, by performing factor analysis on the variables, airlines can gain
insights into which aspects of in-flight services they should prioritize to enhance customer
satisfaction. The goal is to provide airlines with valuable information that can help them
improve their services, increase customer satisfaction with minimum effort, and ultimately
boost profits.
This research seeks to contribute to the airline industry's understanding of the factors
that influence customer satisfaction and provide recommendations for airlines to improve
their in-flight services. Through this, airlines can establish a competitive edge in this
competitive market.
